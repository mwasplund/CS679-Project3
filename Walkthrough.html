      <h2>Walkthrough</h2>
		<p>The controls for our game are fairly straight forward. The players position is controlled by the WASD layout scheme. W will always move the player &quot;into&quot; the screne and D will move him out toward the screen. S and D will move him left and right respectively.</p>
		<p>To target with an attack you simply move the mouse to the side of the player you wish to shoot toward. The left click will cause the player to perform a simple/weak attack that recharges very fast. Right click will perform a more powerful attack that has a larger recharge time. The large attack can either be selected by clicking on the desired icon, or by cycling through the attacks with the scroll wheel on the mouse.</p>

		<p>For the convenience of game play we have also built in a simple 2D mini map that lets a player get a quick view of the walls and badguys around them.</p>

		<p>When playing make sure you keep a close eye on your health bar located in green above your head or on the Heads Up Display as seen below.</p>

		<p>When a new attack is found the player can hover over the attack icon and a tooltip description of that attack will appear.</p>
